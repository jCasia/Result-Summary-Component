# Hi Everyone!

I really wanted give Tailwind css a try as more and more people seem to be using it. It was strange at first, but the documents in the Tailwind website is very well written and quite easy to understand which helped me get started quickly. I'll definitely try to use this more often in my projects in the future!ðŸ˜Š
